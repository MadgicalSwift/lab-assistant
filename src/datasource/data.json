                  "description": "A simple experiment demonstrating how iron filings may be used to plot field lines around:\n A single magnet\n Two magnets (repelling)\n Two magnetic (attracting)\nA current carrying wire. The field line for the current carrying wire are very faint and difficult to see. This is because the field that is produced is very weak. If you look carefully, though, you may be able to make out some concentric circles going around the wire.",

An alcohol and a carboxylic acid are esterified to produce an ester. The reaction of ethanoic acid reacting with ethanol in the presence of conc. H2SO4 as a catalyst to generate esters with the loss of a water molecule will be examined in this process. The ethyl ethaonate ester is generated when ethanoic acid interacts with ethanol.",

The emission colors can therefore be used to identify specific metals. When the metal salts are placed in the flame the electrons in each atom absorb energy. This energy is used to move the electrons from their ground state to an excited state. When the electrons move back to a lower energy level they emit the absorbed energy as a particle of light called a photon.",
